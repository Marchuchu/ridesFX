Trip alerts: Users can set up alerts to receive notifications when trips matching their search criteria are offered.

Intuitive interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, providing a seamless experience for both drivers and passengers.

Technologies used:

JavaFX: The user interface is implemented using JavaFX, enabling the creation of a desktop application with a modern, dynamic look and feel.

Java Persistence API (JPA): JPA is used to manage data persistence, allowing to interact with the database in an efficient and simple way.

Hibernate: Hibernate is used to map Java objects to database tables and manage database operations transparently to the developer.
